We have added Level 4, along with an additonal enemy type, a pink colored slime, 
aka the "Super Slime". These super slimes differ from the normal green ones 
in that they take 2 shots to kill as opposed to one. The new level also 
features a different looking environment.

Improvements:
-Each level now has a mixture of enemies. This mixture of enemies is determined by a preset
probability distribution for each enemy type at each level. For example, on the first level,
for each enemy spawned, there is an 80% chance it will be a basic green slime (the easiest
enemy) and a 20% chance it will be a scientist (the second easiest enemy). While on the 
last level, there is a 60% chance of spawning a super slime while there is a 20% chance 
of spawning a bug and a 20% chance of spawning a scientist.

-There is a new item that is a beer bottle. When the player picks up the beer bottle,
it makes the shots move like a sine wave instead of a straight line. This power-up
helps the player because it greatly increases the hit radius of each shot.

-We have also added a new item type, called "Activated Items". Activated items are items
that don't kick in automatically but are instead activated with the space bar. 
After the player uses an activated item, there is a cool down period before it can be used
again. When the item is in this cool down period, it will appear faded out on the HUD.

-We added a new activated item called the shield. When the shield item is activated, 
a blue aura will appear around the player until the shield wears off. While the shield is
on, the player is invincible and will not lose health if it runs into an enemy or is hit
by an enemy bullet.

-We added another new activated item called the laser. The laser shoots a wide beam in the
direction that the player is currently facing. The laser also can penetrate through walls,
making it useful in many situations. An extra artistic feature related to the laser is that,
when the player is equipped with the laser, the cat is animated with a laser-goggle eye-patch!
