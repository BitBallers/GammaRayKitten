How to run:
    python game.py

How to play:
    WASD to move
    Arrow keys to shoot (directional)
    You need to get to the stairs in the level
    You need a key to open doors
    The syringe is a powerup

CHEAT CODE:
    Typing "0" in level 1 will automatically put you in level 2

Level two Details
    Our level two is also randomly generated. We have a bunch of premade squares (or rooms).
    Our level generation algorithim will then put them into a 4x4 grid, so the level
    is not the same each time! (Randomization is our whole gimmick!)

Improvements:

    New Enemy
        We made a new enemy, a scientist. It shoots bullets at the 
        player. This caused alot of overhauls for the game and needed
        new art 
    More Powerups
        We added a new "pill" powerup that gives you piercing shots
        We added a new "soap" powerup that increases your fire rate
        Each item is randomly picked per level
